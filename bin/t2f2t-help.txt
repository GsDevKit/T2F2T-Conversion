INSTALLATION

DESCRIPTION
	The t2f2t.sh script converts tonel package format repositories to filetree 
	package format repositories using Rowan to manage the conversion.

	The expected usage is that the filetree package directories, tonel package
	directories, and t2f2t meta data directory will be co-resident in the same
	git repository, however, all three directories are independently specified
	so you may configure the directories as you see fit.

	To get started, you will run the following script to register the tonel and
	filetree package directories and create the tsf2t meta data:

		t2f2t.sh --tonel=<tonel-pkg-dir> --filetree=<filetree-pkg-dir> --t2f2t=<t2f2t-data-dir>

	Then you can run either of the other two forms of the command, depending upon
	which format is the primary:

		t2f2t.sh --t2f <t2f2t-data-dir>
	OR
		t2f2t.sh --f2t <t2f2t-data-dir>

  On each invocation the t2f2t.sh script copies and converts all of the 
	packages in the source directory to the destination directory. The 
	t2f2t.sh script does not delete any packages from the destination 
	directory.

EXAMPLES:
	t2f2t.sh --tonel=src --filetree=filetree --meta=t2f2t # create t2f2t metadata directory

	t2f2t.sh --t2f t2f2t                                  # convert package from tonel to filetree

	t2f2t.sh --f2t t2f2t                                  # convert packages from filetree to tonel
